# Community Services Demographic Growth Tool

A Shiny app that combines Community activity recorded in 2022-23, from the NHS England Community Services Dataset (CSDS), as a baseline, with [ONS subnational population projections](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/populationandmigration/populationprojections/bulletins/subnationalpopulationprojectionsforengland/previousReleases) to 2043, to provide projected usage of community services.

Projections are reported by financial year.
The app provides breakdowns of the data:

* by ICB, as well as providing national figures
* by age group.

## Notes

It is important to note that the population figures provided by the ONS are projections, not predictions.
This means that they do not take into account potential changes in national policy around migration, for example, or the risk of major events such as pandemics or climatic events.
The projection used is the principal projection.

The app does not take into account non-demographic change such as mitigations; it is a projection based on 2022/23 recorded activity only.
